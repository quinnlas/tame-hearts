# Rules
## Summary
The game is played in 10 rounds, with smaller hands each round. It is a trick taking game similar to normal hearts (which will be referred to as mean hearts here). Players estimate how many tricks they will take at the start of a round. Points are given based on the difference between actual and estimated tricks taken. Points increase each round. The player with the fewest points after the final round wins.

## Dealing
The dealer position rotates to the left each round. Each player is dealt 10 cards in the first round, 9 in the second, etc. Multiple decks can be used for groups larger than 5. The leftover cards are not viewed by any players during the round. Viewing by the table after the round is played is ok.

## Bidding
After dealing, each player looks at their hand and declares in turn how many tricks they think they will take during the round. Bidding starts with the player to the dealer's left and continues to the left. The bids do not need to add up to the total number of tricks.

## Tricks
The player to the left of the dealer starts play, and can play as though they just took a trick in mean hearts. (Any card except hearts unless hearts is broken or they only have hearts).

As in mean hearts, other players must match the lead suit if they can, and are otherwise free to play any card.

Hearts are considered "trump cards," so if a heart is played, the highest heart takes the trick. If no hearts are played, then the highest card of the lead suit takes the trick. Aces are high.

The player who takes the trick chooses which card to lead, respecting the broken hearts rules as in mean hearts.

## Scoring
After all tricks are played in a round, the scores are calculated. First, determine the difference between the number of tricks you got and the number you bid. This is the absolute difference, so going under or over are equally bad. Multiply the difference by the point value for the round. Points start at 10 and increase by 10 each round, going to 100 in the final round.

After 10 rounds are played, the player with the fewest points wins.

## Unsure
Tiebreaking if same card with multiple decks. It probably goes to the first person to play the card.
